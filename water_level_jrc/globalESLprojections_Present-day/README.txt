The dataset is described in detail in the following article: 
Vousdoukas, M.I., Mentaschi, L., Voukouvalas, E.ÿet al.ÿGlobal probabilistic projections of extreme sea levels show intensification of coastal flood hazard.ÿNat Communÿ9,ÿ2360 (2018). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-04692-w

The data are provided in csv files for all combination of parameter, year and RCP.
The parameters are RSLR, maximum astronomical tide, 100 year meteorological tides (storm surge+wave setup) and the combination of all the above expressed as the 100 year Extreme Sea Level.

Each file contains the following columns: lat, lon, and the values for the median, 5th and 95th percentile.
